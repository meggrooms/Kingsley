# Kingsley Riding USA
Kingsley Riding USA, a leading equestrian establishment, offers personalized saddles, artisanal footwear, and a range of top-notch equine accessories. In a 6-month contract, my responsibility was to create a simple, "tailor-made" website, providing customers with a platform for both local and online orders of their premium equine accessories

<BR><strong>Platform & ecommerce development.</strong> 
This was my first encounter with Shopify. The client's former web developer had opted for Shopify as an all-in-one solution, and I saw no reason to deviate from that choice. However, delving into Shopify presented a steeper learning curve than I had anticipated. Despite this, after immersing myself in tutorials and exploration for several days, I emerged with a newfound familiarity.

I developed a series of maps tailored for Kingsley Riding USA, a provider of custom-made saddles, equine accessories, footwear, and saddle fitting services. These maps were generated utilizing JSON, the Google Maps API, and the National Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI) API.

<h2>Traditional Map</h2>
The initial version of the map featured the conventional daytime view. Although this type of map is widely recognized, its brightness and level of detail proved to be excessive for the desired "bespoke" theme.

<h2>Bespoke Map</h2>
I aimed to ensure that the map harmonizes seamlessly with the website's theme and color palette. I opted for subdued map hues using the retro theme, which I found to be more accessible. I am pleased with the final visual outcome. In addition, I took the initiative to implement filters for the businesses featured on the map, enhancing the user experience by facilitating streamlined item searches for clients.
