# Kingsley Riding USA
A collection of maps I created for use with Kingsley Riding USA, a purveyor of bespoke saddles, equine accessres, footwear, and saddle fitting.

Maps were created using JSON, Google Maps API, and the National Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI) API.

<h2>Traditional Map</h2>
My first iteration of the map was the typical daytime view. <BR>
