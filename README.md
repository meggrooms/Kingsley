# Kingsley Riding USA
A collection of maps I created for use with Kingsley Riding USA, a purveyor of bespoke saddles, equine accessories, footwear, and saddle fitting.

Maps were created using JSON, Google Maps API, and the National Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI) API.

<h2>Traditional Map</h2>
My first iteration of the map was the typical daytime view.

<h2>Bespoke Map</h2>
Kingsley Riding USA is a purveyor of bespoke saddles, footwear, equine accessories, and saddle fitting.<BR>
I wanted the map to match the theme and color scheme of the website, but the reason went beyond that.<BR>
As a person developing colorblindness, I found this map scheme much easier to see and process. I am happy with the map's appearance.
