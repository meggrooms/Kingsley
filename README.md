# Kingsley Riding USA
A collection of maps I created for use with Kingsley Riding USA, a purveyor of bespoke saddles, equine accessres, footwear, and saddle fitting.

Maps were created using JSON, Google Maps API, and the National Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI) API.

My first iteration of the map was the typical daytime view.

<h2>Bespoke Map</h2>
Kingsley Riding USA is a purveyor of bespoke saddles, footwear, equine accessories, and saddle fitting.<BR>
I wanted the map to match the theme and color scheme of the website.
